### Rabbit Message Queue for Android
Implementation minimalized feature of RabbitMQ in android. Goodbye to the fcm API key.

> RabbitMQ is a message-queueing software also known as a message broker or queue manager. Simply said; it is software where queues are defined, to which applications connect in order to transfer a message or messages.
> 

rmqa library minimizes RabbitMQ feature for Android, making it easy to use even without knowledge of Message Brokers. While it only supports broadcast messaging and one-way messaging features.

## Download
```gradle
implementation 'com.utsman.rmqa:rmqa:0.0.2'
```

## Prepare
Open [https://www.cloudamqp.com](https://www.cloudamqp.com) and login or sign up. Create your instance, get the server, username, password and vhost. <br>
For detail, you can read offcial RabbitMQ guide for cloudamqp [here](https://www.cloudamqp.com/blog/2015-05-18-part1-rabbitmq-for-beginners-what-is-rabbitmq.html#set-up-a-rabbitmq-instance)

## Let's Coding !

### 1. Setup connection
```kotlin
val rmqaConnection = RmqaConnection.Builder(this)
        .setServer("server")
        .setUsername("username")
        .setPassword("password")
        .setVhost("vhost")
        .setExchangeName("exchange_name")
        .setConnectionName("connection_name")
        .setRoutingKey("route_key")
        .setAutoClearQueue(true) // By default it is `false`, when the connection is closed, the queue will be cleared
        .build()
```

### 2. Connect and publish for broadcasting message
#### Connect
```kotlin
Rmqa.connect(rmqaConnection, queueName) { senderId, data ->
      // your code when message arrived
  }
```

Messages will be received at each ```queueName``` that has the same ```exhangeName```. ```queueName``` is buffer the stores messages, you can only create one ```queueName``` for one ```rmqaConnection```.

#### Publish / broadcast message
```kotlin
Rmqa.publish(exchangeName, senderId, data)
```
A message will be sent to each ```queueName``` owned by ```exchangeName```.

## 3. Connect and publish for single receiver
#### Connect
```kotlin
Rmqa.connect(rmqaConnection, queueName, Rmqa.TYPE.DIRECT) { senderId, data ->
      // your code when message arrived
  }
```

For this case, the message will be received specifically by the defined ```queueName``` without passing through ```exchangeName```. You cannot multiple connect in one ```RmqaConnection```.

#### Publish single receiver
```kotlin
Rmqa.publishTo(queueName, senderId, data)
```
